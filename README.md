# Age_Gender_Classification
Age and Gender Classification Using Machine Learning

*Project Overview :*

This project demonstrates an age and gender classification model using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. By leveraging libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and Pandas for data handling, the project provides a robust framework for training models capable of predicting age and gender from images.

*Project Structure :*

  - Data Processing: Reads and preprocesses image data for use in the classification models.
  - Image Manipulation: Converts images to grayscale, resizes them, and applies normalization.
  - Model Training: Trains machine learning models to classify images based on age and gender.
  - Evaluation and Visualization: Assesses model performance and visualizes the results to interpret accuracy and efficiency.

*Key Sections :*

  - Data Loading and Preprocessing: Reads image data and prepares it for training by converting to grayscale and normalizing.
  - Feature Engineering: Creates features relevant to age and gender prediction.
  - Model Training: Implements and trains a machine learning model for classification.
  - Evaluation: Uses visualizations and performance metrics to assess the modelâ€™s predictive power.

*Results :*

The notebook provides visualizations and evaluation metrics, offering insights into the accuracy of the age and gender predictions. This information can be used to assess the effectiveness of the model and explore potential improvements.
